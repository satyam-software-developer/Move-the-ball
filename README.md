# Move The Ball Game
A simple browser-based game where the player controls a ball and tries to move it through a designated area using keyboard arrows or WASD keys. The objective is to move the ball without hitting any obstacles or crossing the boundaries.
# Description
This project is a fun and interactive game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player can control a ball using the keyboard's arrow keys or WASD keys. The objective is to keep the ball moving within a confined space without hitting any walls or obstacles that might be added. It features smooth animations, keyboard control, and a simple game loop.
# Features
 1. Ball Movement:

     - The ball moves smoothly when the player presses the arrow keys or the WASD keys.
 2. Responsive Controls:

     - Use the Arrow Keys or W, A, S, D to move the ball in the game space.
 3. Boundaries:

     - The game space has boundaries, and the player needs to ensure the ball doesn't move beyond them.
 4. Collision Detection:

     - The ball is detected against the edges of the container, ensuring it stays within the playable area.
 5. Styling & Animations:

     - The game has a visually pleasing design with simple animations that enhance the game experience.
# Technologies Used
1. HTML:

  - Used to structure the game interface, including the container for the game area and the ball.
2. CSS:

  - Provides styling for the ball, the game area, and visual effects for smooth movement.
3. JavaScript:

 - Implements the logic for detecting key presses, moving the ball, and ensuring it stays within the boundaries of the game area.
#  How to Play
1. Open the game in your browser.
2. Use the Arrow Keys or WASD keys to move the ball around the game area.
3. Ensure that the ball stays within the boundaries, avoiding any potential exits from the game space.
4. The game ends when the ball crosses the boundary (if you've set an end condition) or stays inside for as long as you'd like.
5. Try to achieve a high score or challenge yourself by increasing the game area or speed (for future improvements).
